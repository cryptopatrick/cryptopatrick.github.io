      <p>Hetzner VPS $4.99
Claude Code on Server
Termius for SSH
Was able to build the MVP in hours.
I am not a technical person and this is the 3rd project built using this stack.</p>
<p>The stack is fast and built to really get it to MVP level fast. I use a free email from Free Forward Email .net and I think its really one of the best services out therre thats actually free. This is key because I use it for other services</p>
<p>I then use the free email to setup my Supabase account for a free account which seems to be fine for any mvp product. I use cloudflare free dns, another super value product.</p>
<p>My total investment here is $5.00 and my time really. Please let me know what you think. I would love feedback. Also if you want to try out the whole website, just let me know and I will send out free members user/pass to you.</p>
<p>I wanted to try this out because its a consumer facing app, which looks to bill people rather than just sign them up. Let me know if you want a user pass to test it all the way through.</p>
<p>It was a little rough setting up the stripe but Claude handled it well for me. Any questions, let me know! The last one broke a lot so I am sure I have some bugs here as well.  One other thing I noticed is that Claude Code is a better admin on a single website setup.</p>
<p>doing $30k/mo</p>
<p>I feel like with this, I can streamline this so quickly into a lot of different types of these insecurity style websites. Make me taller,  I saw a photogenic app idea pushed yesterday. I feel like with this foundation I could produce  3 of these in a day. Just zip it up and create a new server on Hetzner and redo the process. My problelm is I have no tik tok or viral app strategy. But this one was fun. Claude did so great on the design to not look like a lovable website.</p>
<p>I did do something differently on this build out. I used chatgpt 5.0 to come up with the build. And this process used a different architecture that Claude didn&rsquo;t use before. It uses workers using PM2? I don&rsquo;t really understand it but Claude allows me to issue more when there is traffic on the server.  On the last project, I had so many free submissions, I was able to go from having 1 worker doing orders to 8 just by asking and claude restarting it.</p>
<p>So Hetzner, I should have mentioned, is the deployment as well. I just ask claude code to setup the ssl and add the domain and I go to cloud flare and point it to the server ip. Claude does the rest.</p>
<p>I guess I should have mentioned this like I have in other posts, I have claude code setup the ssl and the website. So I am deployed where I am built.  Pretty sure I could use git now on it if I wanted to.</p>
<p>Does the VPS have an IP address and you can set the domain name?</p>
<p>Is it basically the development environment AND the host?</p>
<p>So basically, I copy some code from google after I connect to basically install and update some prompts. I just looked up install claude code on vps. Then once claude code is running, I just say, id like to install this domain on /var/www/domain and set that up. It then goes and does nginx and then I put my vps ip in cloud flare. then once i test that and it resolves i ask claude for ssl.. and it does certbot and lets encrypt with zero interaction from me.</p>
<p>So I tried to use GPT5 using the cursor cli on a hetzner vps and it was an awful experience. I immediately ended it and put claude code on to straighten it out. But I noticed 1 thing, GPT5 had built it using workers. Called PM2. I have no idea what they are but when <a href="http://vibeseo.ai">http://vibeseo.ai</a> got super busy, Claude told me I could just instantly activate more workers to run the tasks. So I said activate 15 workers and within seconds they went to work on the queue that had built up. It kind of blue my mind and that build came from GPT5 not claude.</p>
<p>Yes its <a href="http://antipuff.com">http://antipuff.com</a> let me post a full user pass to use and I will nuke it after people overly exploit it.</p>
<p>ok it&rsquo;s live for now. <a href="mailto:demo@antipuff.com">demo@antipuff.com</a> with pass being antipuff normally a user could delete their own images but i removed that for the demo account. its better on desktop than mobile.</p>
<p>Here is a John Mcafee slider. It also uses a diet plan and for now I just have it with a 7 day anti puffy plan that is same for everyone but I think I could add a chat agent in there to custom write for people.</p>
<p>Hi. Thanks for sharing. How do you regression test this when you make a large change? It’s going directly to prod so there’s a strong risk of introducing new bugs unless I’m missing something t.</p>
<p>So at this level im just pushing out to get live and working to MVP. I can install git any time if I wanted or someone else mentioned running different /var/www/domain and running those as versions. But I am not really there yet. I did have to do a few different live upgrades the last time when the website got overloaded.</p>
<p>I have documented the journey over the last week. Termius was mentioned in the original thread that got me going. It was so simple and went across my Mac and my iphone that I took it to see the Weapons movie with me and was coding during the previews. I am actually still on the free plan.</p>
<p>Why terminus for ssh? I have just been using a normal terminal. Am I missing something? I guess you can easily access on your phone?</p>
<p>Yes, its magical to use on the iphone. I find myself out at like movies or other events and rather than scroll social media I am able to chat with claude code and keep it working</p>
<p>No guardrails, It is straight production on the server and live. It is straight to production. No Github, no vercel, no backups. Just push to live mvp really.</p>
<p>This is nice but honestly, Termius is so convenient. What I noticed with Claude Code on the server is that whatever project you are working on, its going to get it running. So I had other projects on the server and claude kind of just ignored them and didn&rsquo;t even restart them on reboots etc.</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>yeah thats why i like to run claude in different git repos where repo == different project - it manages the branching, prs, cleaning up on its own.</p>
<p>so in discord, that&rsquo;d be managed per channel, where you&rsquo;d have one channel per project and then each thread is a separate CC instance for the same project, basically letting you run multiple tasks at the same time.</p>
<p>really unlocks shipping things in parallel. Eg the other day I was working on 3 diff things while at the gym and just reviewing PRs once I got back home</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. I think I should also setup some guardrails to not delete things but honestly, I can not code. So I can&rsquo;t really correct coding. I do know econ a bit and have dealt with developing shopify for projects so I can get it to what I want by speaking to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Awesome. Have been using Hostinger VPS, Termius and Claude Code on the server. Working on moving my current projects from Vercel and Supabase to this stack.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I definately think those other companies are good to use but not if you are basically throwing ideas on the wall. They are slow and cumbersome. I am sure hostinger is pretty much the same.</p>
<p>Well this uses something called PM2 workers. I have no idea what that means. But they work hard for me!</p>
<p>PM2 is a Node.js process manager. Its &ldquo;workers&rdquo; refer to multiple instances (forks) of your application created in cluster mode to leverage multi-core CPUs, improving performance and load balancing. For example, <code>pm2 start app.js -i 4</code> launches 4 workers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s using things I have absolutely no knowledge of. I was using lovable, then learned lovable to git to vercel. Then I learned lovable, to git, to vercel to then use cursor.  And all I have done is just fun projects. I am really more of a domain owner but I started to just develop things for fun. I have $0.00 mrr.</p>
<p>How did you figure out the AI models to use for image transformation?</p>
<p>I used openai. But claude was actually recommending others because openai has a lot of protections about judging beauty etc. I would say there are probably better models for this. But I don&rsquo;t really have access to any others.</p>
<p>How are you managing version control and deployment?
I am pretty sure I can install github after the fact with claude code and go that route.</p>
<p>Do you have a subagent that goes back and take screenshots to make sure the code is doing what it&rsquo;s supposed to?
I just load the website and take a look. Post production and if this had any success, I would then treat it like a real website but this is really just speed to mvp.</p>
<p>&laquo;The most powerful workflow I use is Claude Code (or Cursor) paired with the Playwright MCP (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp">https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp</a>
) which allows coding agents to navigate a browser, take screenshots, read network/console logs, etc. It&rsquo;s the missing link to enable autonomous front-end iteration (without your input).</p>
<p>It is truly magical in dramatically increasing the quality of the output, especially when &lsquo;designing&rsquo; of building UIs. These LLM&rsquo;s are only as good as the context they have, and what they can &lsquo;see&rsquo;. Playwright allows them to see their UI work, and iterate against it.</p>
<p>This is a cheat code.  Add openMemory to it to store all your decisions and you are cranking</p>
<p>One of the simplest but most helpful uses has been adding &ldquo;Please use the playwright MCP server when making visual changes to the front-end to check your work&rdquo; to my <a href="http://CLAUDE.md">http://CLAUDE.md</a> (i.e. .cursorrules) file.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;ll also manually prompt Claude to take screenshots, look at the console/network logs, etc. For fixing bugs, refactoring, creating a PRD, or improving the UI.</p>
<p>Another killer use case is asking Claude Code to &ldquo;use the playwright MCP to look at X feature, and redesign it as an S-Tier Principle designer at Stripe/Airbnb/etc. Please use playwright after each large change to see your work and make further refinements&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>This is for fun. I have no social traffic, I have no tik toks, Instas. I think this could be pushed on social but I built for fun. I have a $0.00 mrr.</p>
<p>Id saw <a href="http://doc.net">http://doc.net</a> is the busiest one I have. It&rsquo;s free of course but it does get some users. <a href="http://Vibeseo.ai">http://Vibeseo.ai</a> got thousands on day 1 but I havent checked it in a bit. But these are all built for fun and learning really.</p>
<p>About 12 months ago, I had an ai idea for a real estate ai agent that would rewrite property listings for agents. I paid $5,000 off upwork, took 3 weeks and this is 10x better and took hours.</p>
<p>Hey. How did you design this?
Looks super cool!
My guy Claude did it.</p>
<p>This website runs using agents called PM2. I have no idea what that means.</p>
<p>Tech stack. Yes, I believe so. I mean I use a free supabase account and a free email account and free cloudflare. And I had a stripe account to use. For supabase I couldnt get mcp to work last time so I just ask for the sql code to do in a copy paste format and do it for Claude.</p>
<p>Yes and really what I learned by having claude code as my admin, was put each site on its own VPS because claude code only focuses on the website you have it working on. I had 4 websites on a server and it would only restart and assign a port to the one it was working on.</p>
<p>This is the $100 monthly. I guess with all this building I am doing I should bump up but no need yet really. I don&rsquo;t do long times on the computer really.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m curios, the while AI analysis was done by Claude Code as well?
Did you train a model somehow?
Openai</p>
<p>&lt;
Great thread.</p>
<p>So as you move past MVP did you hire third party developer to complete the product with all the integrations and finishing touches and customer support?</p>

<strong>▲[^1]</strong> A Rebel ship orbiting above the Federation&rsquo;s top secret military research lab, <em>The Periphery</em>.</p>
<p>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ This is a paragraph.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ This is another paragraph.</p>
<h2 id="concernsmotivation">ConcernsMotivation</h2>
<p>There are a number of reasons to be careful when vibe coding on a VPS:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> - the Ai might execute malicious code and delete valuable data on the server.</li>
<li><strong>YOLO:</strong> - continously accepting the AI&rsquo;s suggested
changes can get tedious, but auto-accepting changes (like Claud&rsquo;s &ndash;dangerously-skip-permissions) is also risky.</li>
<li><strong>Permission:</strong> - some of the operations that the Ai want to use requires <code>root</code> access, which poses a risk.</li>
<li><strong>State Handling:</strong> - Claude Code is stateful which might be problematic if we concurrently access our server from different devices without resetting state.</li>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> - If multiple devs are working on the same project-claude state, that may cause an issue.</li>
<li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> - the Ai usually needs Internet access, so who provides that during long running processes? We want a Ai-coding environment which does not get interrupted due to Wifi disconnets.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>We want our Ai VPS setup to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hands-free:</strong> For a React webapp with a Python FastAPI backend, we want our AI to iterate without our commitment.</li>
<li><strong>Debug:</strong> - we want to be able to debug our webapp using <code>Chrome</code> with the <code>Debug MCP</code> repo.</li>
<li><strong>Persistence:</strong> - Our webapp&rsquo;s backend needs to be able to talk to Supabase</li>
<li><strong>Claude:</strong> - able to run Claude Code.</li>
<li><strong>Cheap:</strong> - cheap is always nice.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to setup and use:</strong> - the Ai VPS needs to be easy to install, maintain, secure (Firewall).</li>
<li><strong>Secure:</strong> - we have to be able to trust our Ai VPS, given that we might be dealing with sensitive data.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>Based on our requirements, we can set the following hardware requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>2 Cores + 8 GB of ram with SSD as minimum hardware reqs.</li>
<li>Low latency (&lt; 50ms) to the area I live in on peak times (NYC Area)</li>
<li>Less than $20 a month (you can buy a reasonable jump box for $120)</li>
<li>Linux on x86 (some things still don’t run great on ARM)</li>
<li>A provider that is considered stable and reliable.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-build">The Build</h2>
<p>Based on our list, we went with <strong>Hetzner</strong>.
We picked a <strong>shared VPS server</strong> located in Nurmberb, Germany with 2 dedicated CPUs, 8GB of ram and 50GB of SSD storage, and with automated backups for $4 a month.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Backups are around $2 a month extra, and we&rsquo;re using extra storage - which could also be scraped.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<p>These were the main steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up account at <a href="https://www.hetzner.com">www.hetzner.com</a></li>
<li>Verify identity</li>
<li>Click through steps deploy shared server:
Ubuntu 24LTS, TODO: stats of box.</li>
<li>Log in to server</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Logging into the server can be a bit tricky, when it comes to SSH keys. Also beware, the VPS console can be extremely slow, but accessing from a loca machine via SSH has so far been fast.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>NoMachine, a paid applications which simplifies remote desktop software, can be used to get a desktop interface for the remote server.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>NoMachine uses port 4000, so make sure to enable that incoming port on the Hetzner firewall</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="setup-and-installations-on-the-vps">Setup and installations on the VPS</h3>
<p>For good practice, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a personal account with sudo, rather than maintaining the machine using <code>root</code>.</li>
<li>Install the usuall Linux machine suspects: git, Xfce, etc.</li>
<li>Rather than installing using the Chrome Linux <code>.deb</code>, try going the repo route.</li>
<li>Make a shortcut to run Chome with the following params to enable your MCP to safely connect</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>        --remote-debugging-port<span style="color:#728e00">=</span><span style="color:#8a7b52">9222</span>

<li>Install the latest stable version of Node.js (try nodesource)</li>
<li>Install Python (sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa)</li>
<li>Install uv (use pipx to install uv)</li>
<li>Install Claude Code (npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code)</li>
<li>Install VSCode (add the Microsoft repo to apt)</li>
<li>Install the VSCode plugins for Claude Code</li>
<li>Install cline (with Claude Code selected for AI provider)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="mcp">MCP</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/benjaminr/chrome-devtools-mcp">https://github.com/benjaminr/chrome-devtools-mcp</a>
For Chrome MCP I used <code>benjaminr/chrome-devtools-mcp</code>, with the following Linux build instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the repo</li>
<li>Make an environment and install the dependencies with uv, make sure to make the environment</li>
<li>Set up the MCP to run it with the <code>—project</code> flag via uv in the repo directory (I’ll show my example below)
++ MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FORWARD SLASH AT THE END OF YOUR PROJECT PATH.</li>
<li>At first I struggled with the “claude mcp” via the command line but it was much easier to just edit the .claude.json file in my home directory.
++  Args should all be broken out (see below, Claude Code is super picky about this config)</li>
</ul>
<p>The other I set up was supabase, but because it’s not running locally this was a snap. You can see the mcp part of my <code>~/.claude.json</code> here:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>`// ~/.claude.json
