      <p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ylecun/status/1640122342570336267">tweet</a> from 2023, Meta Ai researcher and CNN inventor, Yann LeCun conjectures that
&ldquo;Auto-Regressive LLMs are doomed&rdquo;. These are notes taken while trying to understand
his argument.</p>
<h2 id="auto-regressive-llms-ar-llms">Auto-Regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs)</h2>
<p>Claim: Auto-Regressive LLMs are <em>exponentially diverging diffusion processes</em>.
Okay, let&rsquo;s approach this by starting with some definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>diffusion process</li>
<li>exponentially diverging</li>
<li>auto-regressive</li>
<li>LLM</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yann-lecuns-argument">Yann LeCun&rsquo;s argument</h2>
<p>We start by letting $e$ be the <em>probability</em> that any <em>generated token</em> <strong>exits</strong>
the tree of &ldquo;correct&rdquo; answers.</p>
<ul>
<li>$e$: probability that any produced token takes us outside the set of correct answers.</li>
<li>$\mathcal{P}(\text{correct})$: probability that answers of length $n$ is is correct.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#95a5a6">// Let&#39;s create a model that can generate a probability distrubution.
</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#95a5a6">// and then use it to generate longer and longer n-grams.
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then the probability that an <em>answer</em> of length $n$ is <em>correct</em> is $(1-e)^n$
$$\mathcal{P}(\text{correct}) = (1-e)^n$$</p>
<p>LeCun claims that AR-LLMs are <em>doomed</em> and that they cannot made factual, non-toxic,
controllable, and the problem is not fixable without a major redesign.</p>
<hr>
<p>Errors accumulate.
The proba of correctness decreases exponentially.
One can mitigate the problem by making e smaller (through training) but one simply cannot eliminate the problem entirely.
A solution would require to make LLMs non auto-regressive while preserving their fluency.</p>
<p>The full slide deck is here.
This was my introductory position statement to the philosophical debate
“Do large language models need sensory grounding for meaning and understanding?”
Which took place at NYU Friday evening.</p>
<p>I should add that things like RLHF may reduce e but do not change the fact that token production is auto-regressive and subject to exponential divergence.</p>
<p>Most human answers are not produced auto-regressively but are planned ahead.
No exponential divergence there.
Mathematical proofs are discarded if they don&rsquo;t produce the desired result.
So they are not subject to exponential divergence.</p>
<p>counter argument:
this assumes that the errors are unrecoverable (subsequent tokens cannot change the meaning to correct for a rogue generation). I&rsquo;d argue that you never truly exit the tree because you can always emit tokens that revise past statements.</p>
<p>Yann is wrong that the issue is in autoregressive generation. In fact, you can make an autoregressive model generate a full sequence and refine through inverse CDF-like tricks. The result is exactly the same. 1/3</p>
<p>This could plausibly be argued as a result of <em>training</em>, by virtue of the causal attention mask. However, this isn&rsquo;t much an issue in today&rsquo;s LLMs. 2/3</p>
<p>Why? The simple reason is dynamic output length. With chain-of-thought for example, a LLM is secretly a latent variable model. A sequence of length N can depend on an intermediate sequence of length N/2. This is also powerful for enabling adaptive computation 3</p>
<p>ample a sequence u ~ Unif(0,1). Now simply find the sequence x such that F(x) = u. With continuous this is exactly inverse CDF and you can use SGD as the refinement mechanism. With discrete you can use an iterative solver; see eg <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03629">https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03629</a> by @YSongStanford</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an assumption.
It&rsquo;s a fact.
An answer must terminate with an &ldquo;end&rdquo; marker.
There are no subsequent tokens after &ldquo;end&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That would be a kind of planning.
Planning the sequence is clearly a good way to avoid exponential divergence.</p>
<p>The answer generated by LLM has hierarchical content structure by itself. For example, you won&rsquo;t answer people like &ldquo;Yes, I agree&rdquo; but then throw some &ldquo;disagree arguments&rdquo; to me. You decided your answer at the beginning. The later part is explaining &ldquo;why&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You are arguing that answers should be planned ahead.
I totally agree.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not specific to LLMs.
It&rsquo;s specific to <em>any</em> auto-regressive generative process.</p>
<p>-I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s specific to auto-regressive processes, either. Holds for any probability distribution over sequences, including convolutional, energy-based, what have you</p>
<p>No.
Exponential divergence only occurs if you factorize P(y1,y2,y3) as P(y3|y1,y2)P(y2|y1)P(y1).
But you absolutely don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>-I don’t think that’s right.
Given any joint p(y1,y2,y3), you can use the chain rule factorize as p(y3|y1,y2) p(y2 | y1) P(y1), and make the same argument.
This argument doesn’t say anything about AR models. It says that it is harder to predict longer sequences.</p>
<p>I think it depends on what we mean by P().
P(y1,y2,y3) is the &ldquo;real&rdquo; joint t distribution.
You can choose to parameterize it as
Q(y3|y1,y2,w)Q(y2|y1,w)Q(y1|w)
where Q is some trainable function with parameter w.
But you certainly don&rsquo;t have to use this factorization.</p>
<p>-While I don&rsquo;t disagree with you about LLMs, aren&rsquo;t you assuming that each &ldquo;e&rdquo; is independent? That&rsquo;s clearly not the case here.
Yes, I&rsquo;m implicitly making an independence assumption.
Not clear to what extent it&rsquo;s valid or invalid.</p>
<p>-Have thought about tree structure: produce outline then fill in. Reduces length of iteration to log(n)</p>
<p>Yup.
That would constitute a form of hierarchical planning.
The question is precisely how to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Come on, are we saying now that the tokens generated are independent? That&rsquo;s clearly not true, or everyone missed something very important here.
No. We are assuming the <em>errors</em> are independent, so their probabilities can be multiplied.
-Is this mathematically proven or an intuitive conjecture/assumption?
If AI produces a proof of the Riemann hypothesis the probability of it writting CQFD wrong at the end given that the rest of the proof is correct is practically 0 imo.
Again might be missing something here
-This has been pointed out to @ylecun
multiple times and he continues to ignore this to build his exponentially divergent narrative. The errors are not independent and there is no proof provided. As you go a correct subtree, the probability of error also reduces.</li>
</ul>
<p>-so if e is 10e-12, at the end of 32k tokens we got… 0,999999968 chance we got a correct answer
e just need to be sufficiently small; how can we be convinced that it’s not possible?
also, this conjucture is abstract its crazy</p>
<p>Good luck making e less than 10e-12 !</p>
<p>AR-LLM do not &ldquo;search&rdquo;.
That&rsquo;s part of the problem.</p>
<p>-They can use beam search or similar.
Possibly, but that would be super-expensive.
And that would make them non auto-regressive.
-Vaswani etal use beam search in several places, Radford etal don&rsquo;t seem to mention it or any alternative (nucleus, top-k). GPT3 had temp param but that doesn&rsquo;t rule out beam search. Lots of blogs assert yes or no without evidence.
But Radford etal (GPT2) do mention top-k sampling on summarisation tasks.</p>
<p>-The argument assumes that 1 error is enough to diverge. But LMs seem more robust than this.
Also, LMs implicitly plan ahead, as in &ldquo;I climbed an apple tree and picked&rdquo;.</p>
<p>No. It&rsquo;s a tree. One mistake, and you&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>MCTS, beam search, etc would constitute forms of planning and may fix the issue.
The resulting systems would no-longer be auto-regressive.
But they would be <em>insanely</em> expensive at inference time.</p>
<p>-Why is e independent of n? Wouldn’t the probability of error decrease with growing n, as the next token is conditioned on a longer “correct” prefix?</p>
<p>-The chain of words forming a meaningful sentence may be related to the concept of Perplexity. For this, the probability of dependent events is used in the formula. With such methods, divergence may be prevented.</p>
<p>Probability e that any produced token keeps us inside of the set of correct answers.
P(Incorrect) = (1-e)^n
Let e = 0.9
P(Incorrect) = (1-0.9)^9 = 0.000000009
P(Correct) = 1 - 0.000000009</p>
<p>Hey @ylecun
I have discussed this error accumulation problem in a paper where I proposed a novel encoder/decoder architecture <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-30490-4_33">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-30490-4_33</a> while beam search might help, it is impossible in real valued sequences. One solution is one shot prediction (planed pred)</p>
<p>Ask yourself why Microsoft suddenly limited the length of interactions with Bing chat / Sydney.</p>
<p>I thought it was because the system prompt became lost or irrelevant compared with the huge input.</p>
<p>But now I wonder if they could be including something new in the generation so that they are not purely autoregressive and more Alpha - Zero</p>
<h2 id="the-1-en-formula-assumes-only-the-bot-is-doing-the-talking--the-user-responses-if-focused-may-serve-as-a-stabilizing-influence">The (1-e)^n formula assumes only the bot is doing the talking.  The user responses, if focused, may serve as a stabilizing influence.</h2>
