      <description>Preface: I recently coded a tiny Rust library, implenting a cryptographic idea which had caught my interest. This post is my way of cementing my understanding of concepts which I found difficult. I&amp;rsquo;m not a cryptographer and make zero guarantees regarding the correctness of the cor or math in this post. One final note, no Ai was used in writing the story in this post, I wrote it myself, so you can expect it to suck lol.</description>

      <description>TypeState is a powerful design pattern that we can use to provide compiletime checks based on the state of things. This post is my way of writing about what I&amp;rsquo;m learning with the hopes that it&amp;rsquo;ll stick better.</description>
