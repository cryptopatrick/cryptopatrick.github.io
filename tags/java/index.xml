      <description>A beginner-oriented post containing a few fundamental concepts, and usually a step-by-step rudimentary example. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this post will serve as a quick refresher on the covered subject. The content of the post is usually heavily inspired by books and Wiki - my aim is to have a post close at hand if I need to refresh my memory. For proper tutorials and primers - please see other sources on the Internet.</description>
