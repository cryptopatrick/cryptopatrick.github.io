<h2 id="fun-facts">Fun Facts</h2>
<p><strong>Demokraterna</strong><br>
In 2016, I helped start the political party Demokraterna together with Gothenburg politician
Martin Wannholt. I was part of the original steering group that met at the City Hall in
Gothenburg, Sweden. One achievement I am particularly proud of, is that I arranged for
the party to move from its original web address, www demokraternaigoteborg se to www.
demokraterna.se . The later domain was owned by a politician in the Stockholm area. I was
able to contact him via the domain Internet Service Provider and successfully negotiate the
purchase of <a href="https://demokraterna.se/">https://demokraterna.se/</a> . I think that showed initiative from my side.</p>
<p><strong>Locus Sound System</strong><br>
With a group of friends, I organized Klubb Locus (a deep house club night at the venue
Pustervik in Gothenburg) every month for 20 years in a row. This experience tought me a
lot about oranization events, communication, consistent branding and marketing.</p>
