      <description>The Greek historian Polybius
   The Polybius Checkerboard, named after Greek historian Polybius, is an example of a substitution cipher from around 205-123 B.C. .
Polybius was the first to propose a method of substituting different two-digit numbers for a letter in an alphabet. Hence, the Polybius&amp;rsquo; Checkerboard is an early example of a substitution cipher.
Polybius&amp;rsquo; Checkerboard A Polybius&amp;rsquo; checkerboard looks almost like a like a checkerboard.</description>

  The Spartan Scytale was communication device used by the military of Sparta.
The Scytale is an example of a transposition cipher and it dates from around 500 B.C. .
The Ciphering Process   Image: Spartan Scytale
   Setup:
The sender of the message takes a strip of parchement (paper) and wrapps it around a cylindrical rod. Write plaintext message:
The sender writes the message line by line, and parallel to the rod&#39;s axis.</description>

   &amp;ldquo;And after them the king of Sheshach shall drink.&amp;rdquo;
 It might not be obvious, but Sheshach in that phrase is actually one of the earliest examples of secret code, in this case for the name: Babylon.
In this brief post I will go over Atbash, an old substitution cipher technique from around 500 B.C.
 The name Atbash could deride from the story of Babel, where God confused the speech of people, as punishment for trying to build a tower all the way to heaven.</description>
